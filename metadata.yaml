description: What if you were wrongfully accused of a crime, and your growing anxiety
  about the mix-up served only to make your accusers more certain of your guilt? That''s
  the fate that befalls the unlucky protagonist of Edward Bellamy''s Kafkaesque short
  story ""Two Days'' Solitary Imprisonment,"" whose recurring dreams of being unjustly
  persecuted finally come to pass in real life.
